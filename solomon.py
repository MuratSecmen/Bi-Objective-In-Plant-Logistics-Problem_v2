solomon.py — Solomon I1-based sequential insertion heuristic for the
Internal Logistics PD-VRP.

Design notes
============

Naming conventions match the MIP code exactly:
    inst.K               vehicles
    inst.routes_of(k)    routes available to vehicle k, 1..max_routes[k]
    inst.N, inst.Nw      active nodes (depot + work stations)
    inst.P               products
    inst.o[p], inst.d[p] origin / destination of product p
    inst.e[p]            ready time (shift-relative)
    inst.s_load[p]       loading service time
    inst.s_unload[p]     unloading service time
    inst.q_p[p]          product surface area
    inst.q_k[k]          vehicle capacity
    inst.c[(i, j)]       travel time from i to j
    inst.T_max           shift duration

Algorithm
=========

The heuristic is a multi-route generalisation of Solomon I1 sequential
insertion. The fleet has |KR_pairs| empty route slots from the start
(one per valid (k, r) pair, drawn from vehicles.xlsx's max_route
column). At each iteration:

  1. For every unrouted product p, scan every (k, r) slot and every
     feasible insertion position; record the cheapest c_1 over all
     (k, r, position) triples. Cases A / B / C / D handle whether
     o_p and/or d_p already appear in route (k, r).
  2. Among parts with at least one feasible insertion across the
     fleet, pick the one with the highest selection score
        c_2(p) = lambda * c(h, o_p) - c_1^*(p).
  3. Commit the chosen insertion. Subtract p from the unrouted set.
  4. Repeat until either the unrouted set is empty (full feasibility)
     or no remaining part has a feasible insertion (infeasible).

Per-vehicle route chaining
--------------------------

Constraint (14) of the MIP forces route r+1 to start no earlier than
route r returns. The simulator honours this: for vehicle k it computes
route 1 first starting at T_start = 0, then route 2 starting at the
depot return time of route 1, and so on. Vehicles are independent.

Wait-time epsilon constraint
----------------------------

Total waiting time across all products is bounded above by
`heuristic_wait_limit` (config-driven). Insertions that would push
the total wait above the limit are rejected.

Insertion cost
--------------

c_1 = alpha_1 * Δd
    + alpha_2 * max(0, Δ fleet-wide route duration)
    + alpha_3 * max(0, Δ fleet-wide total wait)

Δd is the arc-distance increase from the trial insertion.

The two-objective bias is steered through (alpha_1, alpha_2, alpha_3):
  - Minimise route duration: alpha_1 = 1, alpha_2 = 1, alpha_3 = 0
  - Minimise total wait:     alpha_1 = 1, alpha_2 = 0, alpha_3 = 1
  - Balanced:                alpha_1 = 1, alpha_2 = 0.5, alpha_3 = 0.5

`heuristic_objective` is a label-only config flag that documents the
chosen bias (used for reporting and future 2-opt local search).
